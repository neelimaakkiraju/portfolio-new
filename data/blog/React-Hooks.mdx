React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to enable state management and side effects in functional components without needing class components. This blog explores key hooks and their usage.

# What are React Hooks?

React Hooks allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

<hr />

## `useState`: Managing Component State

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components.

### Example:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<br />

## `useEffect`: Handling Side Effects

The `useEffect` hook manages side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and DOM updates.

### Example:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1)
    }, 1000)

    return () => clearInterval(interval) // Cleanup function
  }, [])

  return <p>Timer: {seconds} seconds</p>
}
```

<br />

## `useContext`: Managing Global State

The `useContext` hook provides a way to share values between components without prop drilling.

### Example:

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const ThemeContext = createContext('light')

function ThemeButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)
  return <button className={theme}>Click me</button>
}
```

<br />

# Advanced Hooks

React also provides additional hooks such as:

- `useReducer` for complex state logic
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimizations
- `useRef` for referencing DOM elements without re-rendering

Understanding and leveraging these hooks effectively can improve the structure and performance of React applications.

## Conclusion

React Hooks make it easier to handle state, side effects, and global data in functional components, reducing the need for class components and improving code readability.
